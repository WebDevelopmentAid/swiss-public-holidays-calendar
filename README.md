swiss-public-holidays-calendar
==============================

An .ics calendar file with Swiss public holidays from 2014 to 2028.

[Mozilla's holiday calendar for Switzerland](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/projects/calendar/holidays/ "Holiday Calendars | Mozilla") ends in 2014. Therefore, we at [WebDevelopmentAid](https://webdevelopmentaid.wordpress.com "Home | WebDevelopmentAid") decided to create a new calendar starting on January 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2028.

It is important to note that the 26 cantons that make up Switzerland set their public holidays independently â€” with the exception of August 1, which is the only federal holiday. If you feel like creating an .ics calendar file for your home canton or your municipality, please do and share!

And for our French, Italian, or Romansh speaking compatriots: We are deeply sorry but for the time being this calendar is in German only. Please go ahead and clone and translate this calendar!

## Properties and Customization ##
All holidays are set as singular, non-repeating all day events, a reminder is set to one hour, and all entries are categorized as "Public Holiday".

If you are not happy with any of these properties, download the file, open it in your favorite text editor, and search-and-replace as you please.

## Disclaimer ##

Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information in this calendar is correct and up-to-date at the time of publication (October 2014), we disclaim any and all responsibility or liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality and reliability of this calendar.
